----
## Technical Specification

This project aims to develop a request management system for Programming School. It utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- Nest.js
- TypeScript
- MySQL (with http://owu.linkpc.net/mysql service)

----
## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your computer:

- Node.js (recommended version 14.x.x or higher)
- NPM (recommended version 6.x.x or higher)

----
## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the project repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd crm
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Create a configuration file named `.env` in the project's root directory and set the required environment variables. Here's an example of the .env file:

```
# Configuration for MongoDB Atlas
MONGO_URI=<MongoDB Atlas connection URI>

# Configuration for MySQL
MYSQL_HOST=<MySQL server host>
MYSQL_PORT=<MySQL server port>
MYSQL_USER=<MySQL user>
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<MySQL user password>
MYSQL_DATABASE=<database name>

# Server configuration
PORT=<server port>
```

Replace the values according to your own configuration.

5. We are utilizing the Prisma CLI. As a best practice, it's recommended to invoke the CLI locally by prefixing it with npx: 

```
npx prisma
```
Now create your initial Prisma setup using the init command of the Prisma CLI: 

```
npx prisma init
```

6. Start the server:

```
npm run start
```

Once the server is successfully running, you will see a message indicating its status.

6. Open your web browser and access the following URL:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the port number you specified in the `.env` configuration file.

7. Enjoy the application :)

----
## Database Migration

The project utilizes database migration to set up the necessary schemas and tables. To perform the migration, execute the following command:

```
npm run migration:run
```
This command will create the required tables in the MySQL database.

----
## Project Details

Upon accessing the project's host, you will be directed to the login page.

The project includes two roles: **admin** and **manager**.

By default, an admin account is available for authentication with the following credentials:

- **Email**: admin@gmail.com
- **Password**: admin

After successful login, you will be redirected to the applications page. The displayed fields for each application include:

- id, name, surname, email, phone, age, course, course_format, course_type, status, sum, alreadyPaid, created_at

The applications are paginated, with a default of 25 applications per page, listed in descending order.

The pagination panel operates as follows:

- When you are on the first page: **First Page**
- When you are on a page in the first half of all pages, excluding the first: **First Half**
- When you are on a page in the second half of all pages, excluding the last: **Second Half**
- When you are on the last page: **Last Page**

The current page should be reflected in the query parameters. When accessing the project via a query parameter, you should be directed to the corresponding page.

Ordering can be applied to each column by clicking on the column name. This triggers sorting in either ascending or descending order, and the sorting choice is stored in the query parameters.

Additional columns are added:

- **manager**: Indicates the manager assigned to process the application.
- **group**: Represents the group to which the application can be assigned.

Clicking on an application expands its details:

- The "Message" and "UTM" fields display information from the database table.
- An input field allows you to enter comments.
- Comments can only be added to applications without an assigned manager.
- Upon submitting a comment, the current user's surname is recorded in the "manager" column, and the status is set to "In Work" if it was previously null or "New."
- The comment, author, and date should be displayed.

Clicking the "EDIT" button opens a modal window with an edit form:

- Only applications without an assigned manager can be edited.
- All form fields can be left empty.
- The form include functionality to add a new group directly from the form (the group name must be unique).
- Performed validation.

The available statuses (Status) are:

- In Work
- New
- Aggre
- Disaggre
- Dubbing

The available courses are:

- FS
- QACX
- JCX
- JSCX
- FE
- PCX

The available course types are:

- pro
- minimal
- premium
- incubator
- vip

The available course formats are:

- static
- online
